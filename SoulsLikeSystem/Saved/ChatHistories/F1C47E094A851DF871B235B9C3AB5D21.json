Instead, it uses your AI character's **CharacterMovementComponent** properties. Here are your options:\n\n### **Option 1: Modify the Character's MaxWalkSpeed**\nThe MoveTo task respects the character's `MaxWalkSpeed` property in the CharacterMovementComponent. You can change it:\n\n- **Before the MoveTo task** - Set the character's MaxWalkSpeed in your AI Controller or via a Service/Task:\n  - Get the Character Movement Component\n  - Set Max Walk Speed (e.g., 300 for slow, 600 for fast)\n  \n- **Dynamically during behavior** - Use a BTService or BTTask decorator to adjust speed based on conditions\n\n### **Option 2: Use Movement Request Configuration**\nThe MoveTo task creates an `FAIMoveRequest` internally. While you can't directly access this in the default task, you can:\n\n- **Create a custom MoveTo task** (C++) that overrides `PerformMoveTask` to customize the movement request\n- Inherit from `UBTTask_MoveTo` and override the behavior\n\n### **Option 3: Runtime Speed Adjustments**\nIn your AI Controller or through a Behavior Tree Service:\n```\nGet Pawn → Get Character Movement → Set Max Walk Speed\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Will It Automatically Activate Animation (Blend Space) Changes?**\n\n**Yes!** This happens automatically through your Animation Blueprint, and here's how:\n\n### **How It Works:**\n1. **MoveTo Task** → Updates the AI character's position\n2. **CharacterMovementComponent** → Calculates velocity based on movement\n3. **Animation Blueprint** → Reads the character's velocity\n4. **Blend Space** → Uses velocity to blend animations\n\n### **In Your Animation Blueprint:**\nYour locomotion blend space typically uses:\n- **Speed** (velocity length) - for walk/run transitions\n- **Direction** (relative velocity) - for directional movement\n\nThe blend space will **automatically update** as the character moves because:\n- The velocity is calculated by the movement component in real-time\n- Your AnimBP's Event Graph or Animation Graph reads this velocity\n- The blend space node uses these parameters to blend animations\n\n### **Common Setup:**\nIn your Animation Blueprint's Event Graph:\n```\nEvent Blueprint Update Animation →\n   Get Owner → Get Velocity → Vector Length → (Speed variable)\n   Get Owner → Get Actor Rotation → Calculate Direction → (Direction variable)\n```\n\nThen in the AnimGraph, your blend space uses these Speed/Direction values.\n\n---\n\n## **Practical Example:**\n\nIf you want your AI Boss to chase at different speeds:\n\n1. **In your Behavior Tree**: Create different states (patrol slow, chase fast)\n2. **Before each MoveTo task**: Use a task to set MaxWalkSpeed (e.g., 300 for patrol, 600 for chase)\n3. **Your Animation Blueprint**: Will automatically read the velocity and update the blend space to show walking vs running animations\n\nThe beauty is that once your AnimBP is set up to use velocity for blend spaces, **everything happens automatically** - the MoveTo task moves the character, velocity changes, and animations blend smoothly!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d76ab-080d-6fb4-8002-1a937a61aa15"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d76ab-d44c-6477-8003-ccedc2c5bbac"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
