When you're seeing \"TargetActor\" printed, you're likely printing the **key name** rather than the **value** stored in that key.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n## The Issue\n\nWhen you use **Set Blackboard Value as Object** in your Boss_AIC:\n- You specify a **Key Name** (e.g., \"TargetActor\")\n- You store a **Value** (your Player_BP reference)\n\nIf you're directly printing the blackboard key or using the wrong node, it will show \"TargetActor\" (the key name) instead of the actual Player_BP object reference.\n\n## The Solution\n\nTo properly verify what's stored in the blackboard:\n\n1. **Use \"Get Blackboard Value as Object\"** with the key name \"TargetActor\"\n2. **Then** print the result from that Get node\n\nHere's the correct flow:\n```\nSet Blackboard Value as Object (Key: \"TargetActor\", Value: Player_BP Reference)\n↓\nGet Blackboard Value as Object (Key: \"TargetActor\")\n↓\nPrint String (or Cast to Player_BP and print)\n```\n\n## What You Should See\n\nWhen printed correctly, you should see something like:\n- `Player_BP_C_0` (the actual object instance)\n- Not just \"TargetActor\" (which is the key name)\n\nWould you like me to take a look at your Boss_AIC blueprint to see exactly what's happening? I can check the logic to confirm this is the issue."},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cb9ae-3629-6eb8-8000-72ac26ac436d"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cb9ae-b89d-684d-8001-e4dd59d1faf2"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
