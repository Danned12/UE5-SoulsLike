This is the standard behavior because:\n\n1. **Animation Sequences store skeletal animation data** - bone rotations, translations, and curves\n2. **Separate objects are actors with their own transforms**, which aren't part of the skeletal animation data\n\n## Solutions and Best Practices\n\n### **Option 1: Use Control Rig (Recommended)**\n\nThe modern workflow is to use **Control Rig** for this purpose:\n\n1. Create a Control Rig for your character\n2. **Add controls/bones in the Control Rig for the props/objects**\n3. Attach or constrain the actual prop meshes to these controls\n4. Animate everything through the Control Rig in your Level Sequence\n5. When you bake, the Control Rig animation will include both character and prop transforms\n\nI noticed you have `CR_Player` (Control Rig) open - you could extend this to include controls for your props!\n\n### **Option 2: Attach Props to Sockets**\n\nIf the props move with specific bones:\n\n1. Create **Sockets** on your skeletal mesh at attachment points\n2. Attach the prop actors to these sockets in the Level Sequence\n3. The props will follow the character's animation automatically\n4. When baking, animate the character normally - props can remain attached at runtime\n\n### **Option 3: Bake Each Element Separately**\n\nFor independent object animations:\n\n1. Bake the character animation separately\n2. Export the object/prop transforms as separate animation data or FBX\n3. Recreate the setup programmatically or through blueprints at runtime\n\n### **Option 4: Use Additive/Layered Animations**\n\nFor weapons or handheld items:\n- Use **Animation Notifies** to spawn/attach objects\n- Create separate animation tracks for prop manipulation\n- Layer these on top of your base character animation\n\n## What I'd Recommend\n\nGiven that you're working with a Level Sequence and have Control Rig available, I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Extend your Control Rig** to include controls for the props\n2. Use **Space Switching** or **Constraints** in the Control Rig to attach props to character bones\n3. Animate everything in the Level Sequence\n4. Bake the full Control Rig animation\n\nWould you like me to help you set up any of these approaches? For example, I could guide you through adding prop controls to your Control Rig or show you how to create sockets for attachments."},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c60fc-c648-6e59-8004-56adc642b180"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c60fd-6398-62ab-8005-a1b24640170b"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"for example riht now I want to make an attack animation where character is lifted by a rock and moved forward together with a rock"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c60fd-6398-62ab-8005-a1b24640170b"}},{"type":"text","content":"Ah, that's a perfect use case for **Control Rig**! Since you already have `CR_Player` open, here's exactly how to set this up:\n\n## Solution: Add a Rock Control to Your Control Rig\n\n### Step 1: Add Controls for the Rock in Your Control Rig\n\n1. Open your **CR_Player** Control Rig\n2. In the Control Rig hierarchy, **add a new Control** (right-click in the rig hierarchy → Add Control)\n3. Name it something like `Rock_Control` or `AttackRock_Ctrl`\n4. Position this control where the rock should be relative to your character\n5. You can also add a **Null** (empty transform) if you want the rock to follow a specific bone or be in world space\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Parent/Space Switching\n\nFor your specific case (character lifted by rock), you have two options:\n\n**Option A: Rock as Parent (Rock lifts character)**\n- Make the rock control independent (world space or root space)\n- Add a **Parent Constraint** node in the Control Rig\n- Constrain your character's root or pelvis to the rock control\n- Animate the rock moving forward and upward\n- The character will follow automatically\n\n**Option B: Character and Rock move together**\n- Create a **parent control** (like `Attack_Root_Ctrl`)\n- Parent both the character root and rock control to this\n- Animate the parent control to move everything together\n\n### Step 3: Animate in Your Level Sequence\n\n1. Open `Enemy_Animations_LS` (your Level Sequence)\n2. Add your **Control Rig** to the sequence (add the skeletal mesh component and assign CR_Player)\n3. In the sequencer, you'll now see:\n   - Your character's bone controls\n   - **Your new Rock_Control**\n4. Add a **Static Mesh actor** (the actual rock visual) to the sequence\n5. In the Level Sequence, **constrain the rock actor's transform to the Rock_Control**:\n   - Add a Transform track for the rock actor\n   - Or use **Attach Track** to attach it to the Control Rig's rock control\n\n### Step 4: Animate Everything Together\n\n1. Keyframe the `Rock_Control` moving forward and up\n2. Keyframe the character's pose (lifted by the rock)\n3. If using parent constraint, animate the constraint weight (0 = not lifted, 1 = fully lifted)\n4. The rock mesh follows the Rock_Control automatically\n\n### Step 5: Bake the Animation\n\nWhen you bake this from the Level Sequence:\n- The **character animation** (including the lift) will be baked into the Animation Sequence\n- The **rock's motion** is driven by the Control Rig control, which is also part of the baked animation\n\n**Important:** For the rock mesh itself:\n- You can either keep it as a separate actor that you spawn/attach at runtime\n- Or if it needs to be part of the animation, attach it to a **socket** on the skeletal mesh that follows a bone controlled by the Rock_Control\n\n### Alternative Quick Method: Use a Bone in the Skeletal Mesh\n\nIf you don't want to modify the Control Rig:\n\n1. **Add a bone** to your skeletal mesh in the Skeleton editor (SK_Mannequin)\n2. Name it something like `Rock_Bone`\n3. In your **Level Sequence**, animate both:\n   - The character's root bone\n   - The Rock_Bone\n4. Attach the rock static mesh to the Rock_Bone in the sequence\n5. When you bake, the Rock_Bone's animation will be included\n\nWould you like me to guide you through any of these steps in more detail? The Control Rig approach is more flexible and professional, but the bone method is quicker if you just need to get it working fast."},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6105-a972-631c-8007-a50759fc683e"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6106-8474-6b52-8008-abea3b609fdd"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"what if I want to make an animation of a rock to pop out of the ground what should I use"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6106-8474-6b52-8008-abea3b609fdd"}},{"type":"text","content":"For a rock popping out of the ground in your attack animation, you have several great options depending on the effect you want:\n\n## **Option 1: Direct Animation in Level Sequence (Simplest)**\n\nSince you're already working in `Enemy_Animations_LS`, this is the most straightforward:\n\n1. **Add the rock Static Mesh** to your Level Sequence\n   - Drag a Static Mesh actor (your rock) into the viewport\n   - Add it to the Level Sequence (click the **+Track** button → Add Actor to Sequencer)\n\n2. **Animate the Transform**\n   - Add a **Transform track** to the rock actor\n   - Keyframe its **Location** and **Scale**:\n     - Start: Underground (Z position low), Scale at 0 or 0.1\n     - End: Above ground (Z position higher), Scale at 1.0\n   \n3. **Add Rotation** (optional)\n   - Keyframe some rotation for more dynamic movement\n   - Add slight wobble/shake\n\n4. **Timing**\n   - Use the curve editor to add **ease-in** for impact feel\n   - Make it pop quickly (0.2-0.5 seconds)\n\n**This approach is perfect when you're baking everything together** because the rock animation timing is synchronized with your character animation.\n\n---\n\n## **Option 2: Add Rock to Control Rig (Best for Baking)**\n\nIf you need the rock motion **baked into the animation** for runtime use:\n\n1. Open **CR_Player** (your Control Rig)\n2. **Add a Null or Control** named `RockSpawn_Ctrl`\n3. In your **Level Sequence**:\n   - Animate this control's transform\n   - Attach your rock mesh to this control (using Attach track or constraint)\n4. When you **bake the animation**, the rock's motion is part of the Control Rig animation\n\n**Advantage:** The rock's spawning motion is tied to the character's animation frames - perfect for gameplay!\n\n---\n\n## **Option 3: Runtime Blueprint Animation (For Gameplay)**\n\nIf you want to **trigger this in gameplay** (not just in cinematics):\n\n1. In your **Player_BP** or **Boss_BP**:\n   - Add a **Timeline** node\n   - Create a float curve (0 to 1) for the animation\n   - Use it to lerp the rock's:\n     - Location (from underground to above ground)\n     - Scale (from 0 to 1)\n\n2. **Trigger from Animation Notify**:\n   - In your animation sequence, add an **Animation Notify**\n   - In the notify event, spawn the rock and play the Timeline\n\n---\n\n## **Option 4: Enhanced with VFX (Polish)**\n\nSince you have **GroundFollowEffect** (Niagara) open, you can add impact effects:\n\n1. **Spawn a Niagara effect** when the rock pops:\n   - Dust/debris particles\n   - Ground cracks\n   - Small pebbles flying\n\n2. In your **Level Sequence**:\n   - Add a Niagara track\n   - Trigger `GroundFollowEffect` or a new \"RockBurst\" effect at the exact frame the rock emerges\n\n3. **Combine with camera shake** for extra impact\n\n---\n\n## **My Recommendation for Your Use Case:**\n\nSince you're making an **attack animation** where the character is lifted by the rock:\n\n### **Use Level Sequence + Control Rig approach:**\n\n1. **In Level Sequence** (`Enemy_Animations_LS`):\n   - Add your rock static mesh actor\n   - Add transform track, animate it popping from ground\n   - Add your character with Control Rig\n   - Animate the character being lifted\n\n2. **Synchronize timing**:\n   - Frame 0-10: Rock bursts from ground (fast pop)\n   - Frame 10-40: Rock continues rising, character rides it\n   - Frame 40-60: Rock (with character) moves forward\n\n3. **Add polish**:\n   - Niagara burst effect at frame 0\n   - Camera shake\n   - Sound cue\n\n4. **For Runtime**: You have two options:\n   - **Option A**: Spawn the rock as a separate actor and animate it via Blueprint Timeline (synced to animation notifies)\n   - **Option B**: Attach the rock to a bone/socket controlled by your Control Rig (baked into animation)\n\nWould you like me to walk through setting up the Control Rig with a rock control, or would you prefer to keep it as a separate actor animated in the Level Sequence?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6110-cafc-680e-800a-e168d5b47fcb"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6111-ed88-6ce8-800b-5be4ae01cba8"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
