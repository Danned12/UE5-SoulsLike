Returns a **float** with the distance in Unreal units\n\n## **Get Horizontal Distance To** (2D Distance)\nThis calculates distance ignoring the Z-axis (useful for ground-based AI):\n\n1. **Drag off your target actor reference**\n2. **Search for \"Get Horizontal Distance To\"**\n3. **Connect the other actor**\n4. Returns a **float** with the horizontal distance\n\n## **Typical Setup:**\n```\nSelf → Get Distance To → Target Actor → Distance (float)\n```\n\nBoth functions use the actors' root component locations for the calculation. The horizontal version is particularly useful for AI behavior (like in your Boss_BP) when you only care about ground distance and want to ignore height differences.\n\n**Note:** If you only need to compare distances (e.g., \"is target closer than 500 units?\"), you can also compare squared distances to avoid the square root calculation, though Blueprint doesn't expose `GetDistanceSquared` directly - you'd multiply your threshold by itself instead.\n\nIs this for your Boss AI behavior tree that you have open?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cf943-7fcd-6153-8000-0522bfefecea"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cf943-fe84-6341-8001-01856cf2fb8a"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
