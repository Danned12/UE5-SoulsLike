Your Player_BP is currently using Enhanced Input's ActionValue directly to AddMovementInput, which doesn't cancel opposing inputs. The Enhanced Input system combines A/D and W/S inputs into a 2D vector, but when both opposing directions are pressed, it doesn't cancel them out - it just reduces the magnitude.\n\nHere's how to implement input cancellation logic:\n\n## Solution: Add Input Cancellation Logic\n\nYou need to intercept the input values from `IA_Move` before they reach `AddMovementInput` and apply cancellation logic. Here's what to do:\n\n### Step 1: Add Input Processing Logic\nBetween your `IA_Move` node and the `AddMovementInput` nodes, add this logic:\n\n1. **Create a custom function** called `ProcessMovementInput` that takes the raw X and Y values\n2. **Add cancellation logic** that checks if opposing inputs cancel each other out\n3. **Return processed values** to use with AddMovementInput\n\n### Step 2: Implementation Details\n\nThe logic should work like this:\n- If X input is close to 0 (no left/right input), keep Y as-is\n- If Y input is close to 0 (no forward/back input), keep X as-is  \n- If both X and Y have significant values, check for perfect cancellation:\n  - If X is very close to 0 after opposing key cancellation, set X = 0\n  - If Y is very close to 0 after opposing key cancellation, set Y = 0\n\n### Step 3: Blueprint Implementation\n\nHere's the specific change you need to make:\n\n1. **Disconnect** the direct connections from `IA_Move.ActionValue_X` and `IA_Move.ActionValue_Y` \n2. **Add comparison nodes** to check if the absolute value is below a threshold (like 0.1)\n3. **Use Select nodes** to choose between 0.0 and the original value based on the comparison\n\nThe basic logic in blueprint form:\n```\nActionValue_X → |ABS| → |< 0.1?| → |SELECT (0.0 or ActionValue_X)| → AddMovementInput (Right)\nActionValue_Y → |ABS| → |< 0.1?| → |SELECT (0.0 or ActionValue_Y)| → AddMovementInput (Forward)\n```\n\nThis way, when you press W+D+A, the X-axis input becomes nearly 0 (since A and D cancel out), and the comparison will set it to exactly 0, giving you pure forward movement.\n\nWould you like me to help you implement this step-by-step, or do you need clarification on any part of this solution?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9aad-f74e-606b-8004-92453b7a0f2e"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9aae-d001-68a0-8005-2d466b6d0092"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"make it step by step"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9aae-d001-68a0-8005-2d466b6d0092"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9acd-fd09-6e70-8007-2c9b13d25ad1"}},{"type":"text","content":"I'll provide you with step-by-step instructions to implement input cancellation logic in your Player_BP. Let's break this down into clear, actionable steps:\n\n## Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n### Step 1: Disconnect Current Connections\n1. In your **Player_BP EventGraph**, locate the `IA_Move` node\n2. **Right-click** on the connection from `IA_Move → ActionValue_X` to `AddMovementInput (Right) → ScaleValue`\n3. Select **\"Break Link\"**\n4. **Right-click** on the connection from `IA_Move → ActionValue_Y` to `AddMovementInput (Forward) → ScaleValue`  \n5. Select **\"Break Link\"**\n\n### Step 2: Add Input Cancellation Logic for X-Axis (Left/Right)\n1. **Right-click** in empty space and search for **\"Abs (float)\"**\n2. **Connect** `IA_Move → ActionValue_X` to the **input** of the `Abs` node\n3. **Right-click** in empty space and search for **\"< (float)\"** (Less Than)\n4. **Connect** the `Abs` node output to the **A input** of the `< (float)` node\n5. In the **B input** of the `< (float)` node, type **0.1** (this is your cancellation threshold)\n\n### Step 3: Add Select Node for X-Axis\n1. **Right-click** in empty space and search for **\"Select (float)\"**\n2. **Connect** the `< (float)` output to the **Index input** of the `Select` node\n3. In the **Option 0** input of the Select node, connect the original `IA_Move → ActionValue_X`\n4. In the **Option 1** input of the Select node, type **0.0**\n5. **Connect** the `Select` output to `AddMovementInput (Right) → ScaleValue`\n\n### Step 4: Repeat for Y-Axis (Forward/Back)\n1. **Right-click** and add another **\"Abs (float)\"** node\n2. **Connect** `IA_Move → ActionValue_Y` to this new `Abs` node\n3. **Right-click** and add another **\"< (float)\"** node\n4. **Connect** the second `Abs` output to the **A input** of the second `< (float)` node\n5. Set **B input** to **0.1**\n\n### Step 5: Add Select Node for Y-Axis\n1. **Right-click** and add another **\"Select (float)\"** node\n2. **Connect** the second `< (float)` output to the **Index input** of this Select node\n3. In **Option 0**, connect the original `IA_Move → ActionValue_Y`\n4. In **Option 1**, type **0.0**\n5. **Connect** this Select output to `AddMovementInput (Forward) → ScaleValue`\n\n### Step 6: Compile and Test\n1. **Click \"Compile\"** in the Blueprint toolbar\n2. **Click \"Save\"**\n3. **Play the game** and test:\n   - Press W+D: Should move diagonally (45°)\n   - Press W+D+A: Should move straight forward (0°)\n   - Press A+D: Should not move (cancelled out)\n\n## What This Logic Does:\n- **Abs nodes**: Get the absolute value of input (removes negative sign)\n- **< 0.1 comparison**: Checks if the input is very small (near zero due to cancellation)\n- **Select nodes**: Choose between the original input or 0.0 based on the comparison\n- **Threshold 0.1**: Any input smaller than 0.1 gets set to exactly 0.0\n\n## Visual Flow:\n```\nActionValue_X → Abs → < 0.1? → Select(Original or 0.0) → Right Movement\nActionValue_Y → Abs → < 0.1? → Select(Original or 0.0) → Forward Movement\n```\n\nThis ensures that when opposing inputs nearly cancel each other out (like A+D), they become exactly 0, giving you clean directional movement.\n\nLet me know if you need clarification on any of these steps!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9ace-d5bb-686d-8008-ca8e2b5f1169"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"it doesnt work can you check what did I do wrong"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9ace-d5bb-686d-8008-ca8e2b5f1169"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9af4-301e-6701-800a-69ddfffae1d4"}},{"type":"text","content":"Let me check your current Player_BP implementation to see what might be going wrong:"},{"type":"tool_call","info":{"name":"read_blueprint","input":{"blueprint":"/Game/Blueprint/Player_BP.Player_BP","mode":"balanced"},"reply_id":"tool_reply:read_blueprint:43d98bd1-2838-409a-8f38-e7d49097353d:8ED439F64AB9C0F7FA98418CB89AE549:toolu_012byTdEfYS9Zm5LtzBu2ZL3","metadata":null}},{"type":"tool_result","info":{"name":"read_blueprint"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0a9af4-66ac-6100-800b-af6af8dfebbd"}},{"type":"text","content":"I found the issue!
