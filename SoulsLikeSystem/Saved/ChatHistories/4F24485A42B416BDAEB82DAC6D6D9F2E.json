Let me clarify your current setup to give you the best solution:\n\n**A few questions:**\n1. Do you already have a target lock-on system implemented, or are you looking to create one?\n2. Are you currently using **bUseControllerRotationYaw** on your character?\n3. Is your camera on a Spring Arm component?\n\n**Common approach for this setup:**\n\nThe typical solution is to **decouple character rotation from controller rotation**:\n\n**For Character Rotation Control:**\n- Set `bUseControllerRotationYaw = false` on your Pawn/Character\n- Set `bOrientRotationToMovement = true` on the Character Movement Component (for normal movement)\n- During roll, you can control rotation separately\n\n**For Camera Lock-On:**\n- Keep the controller/camera pointing at the enemy using `SetControlRotation()` or by rotating the Spring Arm\n- The character body can rotate independently based on movement or stay facing the roll direction\n\n**Typical implementation:**\n```cpp\n// In Tick or event\nif (bIsLockedOnEnemy && EnemyTarget)\n{\n    // Calculate look-at rotation toward enemy\n    FRotator LookAtRotation = (EnemyTarget->GetActorLocation() - SpringArm->GetComponentLocation()).Rotation();\n    \n    // Smooth camera rotation\n    FRotator NewRotation = FMath::RInterpTo(SpringArm->GetComponentRotation(), LookAtRotation, DeltaTime, LockOnSpeed);\n    SpringArm->SetWorldRotation(NewRotation);\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to look at your Player_BP blueprint to see your current setup and provide more specific guidance?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d3b7b-e64e-6f91-8000-8b8c4832e451"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d3b7c-7521-6e7f-8001-9e5eb89ba427"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
