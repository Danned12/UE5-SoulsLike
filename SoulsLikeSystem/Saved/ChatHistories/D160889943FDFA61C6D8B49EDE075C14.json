I can see your blueprint already has a solid foundation for the targeting system. You have:\n\n- **IsTargeting** boolean to track targeting state\n- **CurrentTarget** actor variable to store the target\n- Sphere trace for target detection\n- Controller rotation toward target in EventTick\n\nCurrently, your system only rotates the **controller/camera** toward the target. For **full character rotation** (Option 1), you need to also rotate the **character's actor rotation** toward the target.\n\nHere's how to implement full character rotation step by step:\n\n## Implementation Steps:\n\n### 1. **Modify the EventTick Logic**\nIn your EventTick event where you currently have the targeting rotation logic, you need to:\n\n1. **Add a Branch node** after your existing `Get` node that checks if targeting is active\n2. **Add Actor Rotation** alongside the existing controller rotation\n\n### 2. **Add Smooth Character Rotation**\nInstead of just using `SetControlRotation`, you'll want to add:\n\n1. **FindLookAtRotation** (you already have this)\n2. **RInterp To** node for smooth character rotation\n3. **SetActorRotation** to actually rotate the character\n\n### 3. **Key Nodes to Add:**\n- **RInterp To** (for smooth rotation interpolation)\n- **SetActorRotation** (to rotate the character body)\n- Use **DeltaSeconds** from EventTick for smooth interpolation\n\n### 4. **Logic Flow:**\n```\nEventTick → Branch (IsTargeting?) \n    → TRUE: \n        - FindLookAtRotation (Player → Target)\n        - RInterp To (Current Actor Rotation → Target Rotation, DeltaTime, InterpSpeed)\n        - SetActorRotation (New Interpolated Rotation)\n        - SetControlRotation (for camera)\n    → FALSE: Normal behavior\n```\n\n### 5. **Add Variables:**\n- **RotationSpeed** (Float) = 5.0 (controls how fast character rotates toward target)\n\nWould you like me to walk through modifying your existing EventTick logic, or would you prefer to implement this step by step? The key is using **RInterp To** with your existing **FindLookAtRotation** result and applying it to both the actor rotation and control rotation."},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af544-2573-6a62-8004-5eb2fa6f5a8d"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af544-d7f7-6d1c-8005-75d49e5d85d1"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"step by step"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af544-d7f7-6d1c-8005-75d49e5d85d1"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af561-6b32-63a2-8007-2880f2c22da1"}},{"type":"text","content":"Perfect!

In your **Player_BP**, go to the **Variables** panel\n2. Click the **+** button to create a new variable\n3. Name it: **RotationSpeed**\n4. Set the variable type to **Float**\n5. Set the default value to **5.0** (you can adjust this later)\n6. Make it **Instance Editable** so you can tweak it in-game\n\n## Step 2: Locate Your Existing Targeting Logic\n\nFind your **EventTick** node where you currently have the targeting rotation logic. You should see something like:\n- Branch checking **IsTargeting**\n- **FindLookAtRotation** from player to target\n- **SetControlRotation** to rotate the camera\n\n## Step 3: Add Character Rotation Logic\n\nNow let's add the character body rotation alongside your existing controller rotation:\n\n1. **After your FindLookAtRotation node**, instead of going directly to SetControlRotation, add:\n\n2. **Add RInterp To (Rotator) node:**\n   - **Current:** Get Actor Rotation (drag from your character reference)\n   - **Target:** Connect from your FindLookAtRotation output\n   - **DeltaTime:** Get the **Delta Seconds** output from your EventTick node\n   - **Interp Speed:** Connect your **RotationSpeed** variable\n\n3. **Add SetActorRotation node:**\n   - **New Rotation:** Connect from RInterp To output\n   - **Target:** Connect to your character reference (usually self)\n\n4. **Keep your existing SetControlRotation** for the camera\n\n## Step 4: Wire Everything Together\n\nYour flow should now look like this:\n```\nEventTick → Branch (IsTargeting = True) →\n    FindLookAtRotation (Self → CurrentTarget) →\n        ├── RInterp To (Current Actor Rotation → Target Rotation) →\n        │   └── SetActorRotation\n        └── SetControlRotation (for camera)\n```\n\n## Step 5: Optional - Constrain Pitch Rotation\n\nFor better character movement, you might want to only rotate on the **Yaw axis** (left/right):\n\n1. After **RInterp To**, add a **Break Rotator** node\n2. Add a **Make Rotator** node\n3. Connect only the **Yaw** from Break Rotator to Make Rotator\n4. Set **Pitch** and **Roll** to **0.0**\n5. Feed this to **SetActorRotation**\n\n## Step 6: Test and Adjust\n\n1. **Compile** your blueprint\n2. Test the targeting system\n3. Adjust the **RotationSpeed** value:\n   - **Higher values** (8-10) = faster rotation\n   - **Lower values** (2-4) = slower, smoother rotation\n\nWould you like me to walk you through any specific step in more detail, or do you need help with the node connections?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af562-1e04-68cf-8008-d6d22409d8f2"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"check for errors for some reason my character only looks in 1 deraction"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af562-1e04-68cf-8008-d6d22409d8f2"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af571-f065-6a95-800a-bdaffb3f6aff"}},{"type":"text","content":"Let me examine your current Player_BP implementation to identify the issue with the character only looking in one direction."},{"type":"tool_call","info":{"name":"read_blueprint","input":{"blueprint":"/Game/Blueprint/Player_BP.Player_BP","mode":"balanced"},"reply_id":"tool_reply:read_blueprint:43d98bd1-2838-409a-8f38-e7d49097353d:D160889943FDFA61C6D8B49EDE075C14:toolu_01Bt9TtsKevefbSuxsAMmBBF","metadata":null}},{"type":"tool_result","info":{"name":"read_blueprint"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af572-3184-6421-800b-7bbd5516ebf0"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af572-4303-65b7-800c-cc60b0502770"}},{"type":"text","content":"I found the issue!

The issue is that your **movement-based rotation system** is conflicting with your **lock-on rotation system**. When you move while targeting, both systems are trying to control the character's rotation simultaneously.\n\nLooking at your blueprint, I can see you have movement rotation logic that rotates the character based on movement direction. We need to **disable movement-based rotation when targeting is active**.\n\n## The Fix: Add Targeting Checks to Movement Rotation\n\nHere's how to resolve the conflict:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Movement Rotation Logic\nIn your blueprint, find the movement rotation logic. I can see you have:\n- `SetActorRotation_0` that uses movement vector calculations\n- Roll direction and movement-based rotation code\n- This happens around your movement input handling\n\n### Step 2: Add IsTargeting Branch Before Movement Rotation\n1. **Before your movement-based SetActorRotation calls**, add a **Branch** node\n2. **Connect** the **Condition** to your **IsTargeting** variable  \n3. **Wire the logic** so movement rotation only happens when **NOT targeting**:\n\n```\nMovement Input → Branch (IsTargeting?)\n    → TRUE: Skip movement rotation (do nothing)\n    → FALSE: Apply normal movement rotation\n```\n\n### Step 3: Specific Nodes to Modify\nLook for these rotation-related nodes in your movement logic and add targeting checks:\n\n1. **Find** `SetActorRotation_0` (the one connected to movement calculations)\n2. **Add** a Branch before it that checks `IsTargeting == False`\n3. **Only execute** movement rotation when not targeting\n\n### Step 4: Alternative Approach - Movement Mode Variable\nYou could also create a more comprehensive system:\n\n1. **Create** a new boolean variable: **UseMovementRotation**\n2. **Set** `UseMovementRotation = False` when targeting starts\n3. **Set** `UseMovementRotation = True` when targeting ends\n4. **Use** this variable to control all movement-based rotation logic\n\n## Implementation Example:\n```\nBefore Movement Rotation:\nBranch (IsTargeting == False) \n    → TRUE: Apply movement rotation (SetActorRotation)\n    → FALSE: Skip (character keeps facing target)\n```\n\nThis way:\n- **When targeting:** Character only rotates toward target, ignores movement direction\n- **When not targeting:** Normal movement rotation works as expected\n\nWould you like me to walk you through finding the specific movement rotation nodes that need this targeting check?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af57c-40ba-65ac-8010-da1e4e06f6ad"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"set actor rotation is only in roll function and it doesnt effect anything as long as I dont roll"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af57c-40ba-65ac-8010-da1e4e06f6ad"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0af594-6b40-67b3-8012-49d6bd2f6cbc"}},{"type":"text","content":"You're right!

Now I understand the real issue. The problem is your **Character Movement Component's** built-in `bOrientRotationToMovement` setting. This automatically rotates the character to face the movement direction, which conflicts with your lock-on system.\n\n## The Solution: Disable Orient Rotation to Movement During Targeting\n\nYou need to **dynamically control** the `bOrientRotationToMovement` property based on your targeting state.\n\n### Step 1: When Targeting Starts (Target Lock On)\nIn your targeting activation logic, add:\n\n1. **Get Character Movement** component\n2. **Set Orient Rotation to Movement** = **False**\n\n### Step 2: When Targeting Ends (Target Lock Off) \nIn your targeting deactivation logic, add:\n\n1. **Get Character Movement** component  \n2. **Set Orient Rotation to Movement** = **True**\n\n### Step 3: Implementation in Your Blueprint\n\n**Find your targeting toggle logic** (where `IsTargeting` gets set to True/False) and add these nodes:\n\n#### When IsTargeting = True:\n```\nBranch (NewTargeting = True) →\n    Set IsTargeting = True →\n    Get Character Movement →\n    Set Orient Rotation to Movement = FALSE\n```\n\n#### When IsTargeting = False:\n```\nBranch (NewTargeting = False) →\n    Set IsTargeting = False →\n    Get Character Movement →\n    Set Orient Rotation to Movement = TRUE\n```\n\n### Step 4: Alternative Approach - Single Function\nYou could create a helper function that handles both:\n\n1. **Create a new function** called \"**SetTargetingMode**\"\n2. **Input:** Boolean \"**EnableTargeting**\"\n3. **Logic:**\n   ```\n   Set IsTargeting = EnableTargeting\n   Get Character Movement\n   Set Orient Rotation to Movement = NOT EnableTargeting\n   ```\n\nThis way:\n- **When targeting:** Character faces target (your lock-on rotation works)\n- **When not targeting:** Character faces movement direction (normal behavior)\n- **No rotation conflict** between the
