Here's how to constantly update blackboard variables in your Behavior Tree:\n\n## Using BT Services\n\n**BT Services** are designed specifically for this purpose - they tick at regular intervals while their branch is active in the Behavior Tree.\n\n### Key Properties:\n\n1. **Interval** - Time between ticks (in seconds)\n2. **Random Deviation** - Adds randomness to the interval\n3. **bCallTickOnSearchStart** - Whether to tick immediately when the branch becomes active\n4. **bRestartTimerOnEachActivation** - Resets tick timer when node activates\n\n### Two Ways to Create Services:\n\n#### 1. **Blueprint Service** (What you're already using!)\nYour `BTService_UpdatePlayerInfo` is the right approach:\n\n- Right-click in Content Browser → Behavior Tree → Service Blueprint\n- Override the **Receive Tick AI** event\n- Set blackboard values using **Set Blackboard Value As...** nodes\n- Configure the **Interval** in the class defaults\n\n#### 2. **C++ Service**\nInherit from `UBTService` and override:\n```cpp\nvoid TickNode(UBehaviorTreeComponent& OwnerComp, uint8* NodeMemory, float DeltaSeconds) override\n{\n    UBlackboardComponent* BlackboardComp = OwnerComp.GetBlackboardComponent();\n    // Update your blackboard values here\n    BlackboardComp->SetValueAsVector(\"TargetLocation\", NewLocation);\n}\n```\n\n### How to Add to Your Behavior Tree:\n\nServices attach to **Composite nodes** (Selector/Sequence) or **Task nodes**. They run continuously while that branch is active:\n\n1. Select a Composite or Task node in your `Boss_BT`\n2. Right-click and choose \"Add Service\"\n3. Select your service (e.g., `BTService_UpdatePlayerInfo`)\n4. Configure the tick interval in the Details panel\n\nThe service will now update your blackboard variables at the specified interval for as long as that branch remains active!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cf908-b128-6e62-8002-36431c3823f1"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0cf909-1a7a-62a8-8003-0804d498cc87"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
