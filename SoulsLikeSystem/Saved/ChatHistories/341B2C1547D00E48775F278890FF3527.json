This is a common architectural decision in Behavior Tree design. Here's my breakdown:\n\n## **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**\n\nThe best practice is typically a **combination of both**, depending on the complexity and reusability:\n\n### **Use Built-in/Custom Tasks For:**\n- **Reusable behaviors** (MoveTo, Wait, PlayAnimation)\n- **AI-specific logic** (pathing, perception, target selection)\n- **Generic operations** that multiple AI might use\n- **Flow control** and decision-making\n\n### **Use Blueprint Function Calls For:**\n- **Boss-specific behaviors** (unique attacks, phase transitions)\n- **Complex animations/montages** with specific timing\n- **Character-specific logic** that's tightly coupled to your Boss class\n- **Rapid prototyping** and iteration\n\n## **Pros & Cons**\n\n**Tasks in Behavior Tree:**\n- ✅ Cleaner BT visualization\n- ✅ Easier to reuse across different AI\n- ✅ Better separation of concerns\n- ❌ More setup (creating task classes)\n\n**Blueprint Function Calls:**\n- ✅ Faster iteration (no new task creation)\n- ✅ Logic stays with the character\n- ✅ Better for unique, non-reusable behaviors\n- ❌ BT becomes a \"thin controller\"\n- ❌ Less reusable\n\n## **Recommended Structure for Boss:**\n\n```\nBehavior Tree (Boss_BT):\n├─ Selector/Sequence nodes (flow control)\n├─ MoveTo task (built-in)\n├─ Custom \"ExecuteBossAttack\" task → calls Boss_BP function\n├─ Wait task (built-in)\n└─ Blackboard value updates (conditions/decorators)\n```\n\n**The BT handles:** State management, conditions, flow  \n**The Boss Blueprint handles:** Actual attack execution, animations, VFX\n\nThis gives you the best of both worlds - clear BT logic with flexible, boss-specific implementation details in your Blueprint.\n\nDoes this help clarify the approach? What kind of boss behaviors are you implementing?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d769b-c7f6-6c6e-8000-9691fe2dabf7"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d769c-6e9b-685e-8001-84a003e17422"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
