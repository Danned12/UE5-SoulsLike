To create a 3-way branch based on boolean values, you'll use **Selector nodes** with **Blackboard Decorators**.\n\nHere's how to structure it:\n\n## Setup Structure:\n\n1. **In Boss_BB (Blackboard)**: Add the boolean keys you need (e.g., `bCondition1`, `bCondition2`)\n\n2. **In Boss_BT**: Create this hierarchy:\n   ```\n   Root\n   └── Selector\n       ├── Sequence (Branch 1)\n       │   └── [Tasks for condition 1]\n       ├── Sequence (Branch 2)\n       │   └── [Tasks for condition 2]\n       └── Sequence (Branch 3 - Fallback)\n           └── [Default tasks]\n   ```\n\n## How to Set It Up:\n\n1. **Add a Selector node** - This evaluates children left-to-right until one succeeds\n\n2. **For Branch 1**: \n   - Add a Sequence node under the Selector\n   - Right-click the Sequence → Add Decorator → **Blackboard Based Condition**\n   - Set it to check your first boolean (e.g., `bCondition1 == true`)\n   - Add your tasks under this Sequence\n\n3. **For Branch 2**:\n   - Add another Sequence node\n   - Add Blackboard decorator checking second boolean (e.g., `bCondition2 == true`)\n   - Add your tasks\n\n4. **For Branch 3** (fallback):\n   - Add a third Sequence with either:\n     - No decorator (always runs if others fail), OR\n     - Decorator checking both bools are false\n\nThe Selector will try each branch in order. The first branch whose decorator condition is true will execute!\n\nWould you like me to take a look at your current Boss_BT to provide more specific guidance?"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d755e-38e5-64ed-8000-ed7dd3076761"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0d755e-e4e0-6086-8001-3c5844e6d8a7"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
