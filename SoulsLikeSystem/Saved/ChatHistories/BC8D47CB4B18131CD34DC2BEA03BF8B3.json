The best approach depends on **how you'll use this animation**:\n\n## **Level Sequence** - Best for:\n- ✅ **Cinematic sequences** or one-off scripted events\n- ✅ Precise keyframe control over position, rotation, scale\n- ✅ Coordinating multiple elements (camera, lighting, VFX, sound)\n- ✅ Pre-visualizing or creating in-game cutscenes\n\n**Pros:** Visual timeline editor, easy to iterate, can animate any property  \n**Cons:** Less flexible for repeated gameplay events, requires triggering via Blueprint\n\n## **Blueprint Timeline** - Best for:\n- ✅ **Gameplay mechanics** (rocks popping repeatedly)\n- ✅ Dynamic, reusable animations\n- ✅ Responding to player actions or game events\n- ✅ Procedural or parameterized animations\n\n**Pros:** Code-driven, reusable, can pass parameters, better performance for repeated events  \n**Cons:** Requires Blueprint setup, less visual than Level Sequence\n\n## **My Recommendation:**\n\nFor a **rock popping out of the ground**, I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Level Sequence** if it's a **cinematic moment** or specific story beat\n2. **Blueprint with Timeline** if it's a **gameplay mechanic** (like obstacles appearing)\n\n### Quick Blueprint Timeline approach:\n- Create a Timeline in your rock Blueprint\n- Animate Z-position (elevation) and possibly scale\n- Add rotation for dynamic effect\n- Trigger with custom events\n- Optionally spawn particle effects for dust/debris\n\n### Level Sequence approach:\nYou already have `Enemy_Animations_LS` open - you could create a similar sequence for the rock, animate its transform, and trigger it when needed.\n\n**Would you like help setting up either approach?** Let me know your use case and I can guide you through the specific implementation!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6118-4f1f-6a76-8000-e5806097d247"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6118-ea4f-6297-8001-e56e861bc8f2"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"what if its a more complex animation for example a lot of pieces coming together in one you cant make it in timeline or can you?"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6118-ea4f-6297-8001-e56e861bc8f2"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6141-842b-6dd5-8002-e18ba9171157"}},{"type":"text","content":"Great question! You're touching on an important limitation. **Technically yes**, you *can* do it with Blueprint Timelines, but it becomes **extremely impractical** with many pieces. Here's the breakdown:\n\n## **Blueprint Timeline Limitations:**\n- ❌ You'd need to manually animate **each piece individually**\n- ❌ Controlling timing/curves for 50+ pieces = nightmare\n- ❌ No visual preview of the full animation\n- ❌ Hard to iterate and adjust\n- ❌ Basically doing everything in code/curves\n\n## **Level Sequence - PERFECT for this:**\n- ✅ **Animate dozens/hundreds of pieces** in one timeline\n- ✅ Visual editor - see everything happening in real-time\n- ✅ Keyframe all transforms at once\n- ✅ Use curve editors for smooth motion\n- ✅ Layer animations, add easing, timing offsets\n- ✅ Can animate materials, visibility, spawning effects\n\n### **For \"many pieces coming together\":**\n\n**Level Sequence approach:**\n1. Place all rock pieces in the world (or as spawnables)\n2. Add them to the Level Sequence\n3. Keyframe start positions (scattered/underground)\n4. Keyframe end position (assembled rock)\n5. Offset timing for each piece for a cascade effect\n6. Add curves for organic motion\n\n## **Alternative Approaches:**\n\n### **1. Control Rig** (I see you have `CR_Player` open!)\n- Great for **procedural** or **skeleton-based** assembly\n- Can drive many pieces from a control hierarchy\n- More technical but very powerful\n\n### **2. Niagara System** (you have `GroundFollowEffect` open)\n- Perfect for **particle-based** assembly effects\n- Can spawn/animate hundreds of pieces\n- Great for magical or organic formations\n\n### **3. Geometry Collection**\n- Ideal for **destruction in reverse**\n- Physics-based assembly\n- Can use decay/sleep systems from the engine\n\n## **My Recommendation:**\n\nFor **complex multi-piece animations**, use **Level Sequence** 99% of the time:\n- It's designed exactly for this\n- Sequencer is one of UE's most powerful animation tools\n- You can trigger it from Blueprint when needed\n\n**Would you like me to explain how to set up a Level Sequence for this kind of assembly animation?** I can walk you through the workflow!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6141-845c-6728-8003-5d6fe79bf03a"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6142-25b4-6171-8004-2556b5617cda"}}]},{"role":"user","message_blocks":[{"type":"text","content":"but in level sequence tou can only bake control rigs in animation how do you make animations with objects so I can use tham in game"}]},{"role":"assistant","message_blocks":[{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6142-25b4-6171-8004-2556b5617cda"}},{"type":"text","content":"Ah, I see the confusion! You're mixing up **AnimSequence** and **Level Sequence** - they're completely different systems:\n\n## **AnimSequence vs Level Sequence:**\n\n### **AnimSequence** (you have `Test_Sequence` open)\n- ❌ **Only for skeletal meshes** (characters with bones)\n- ❌ Requires baking from Control Rigs\n- ✅ Used with Animation Blueprints\n- ✅ Plays on skeletal mesh components\n\n### **Level Sequence** (you have `Enemy_Animations_LS` open)\n- ✅ **Animates ANY object** - Static Meshes, Actors, Blueprints, lights, materials, etc.\n- ✅ **No baking required** - works directly\n- ✅ Can be triggered and played in-game\n- ✅ Perfect for your rock pieces animation\n\n## **How to Use Level Sequences in Game:**\n\nLevel Sequences are **directly playable in-game**. Here's how:\n\n### **Method 1: Place Level Sequence Actor in World**\n1. Drag your Level Sequence into the level\n2. It creates a **Level Sequence Actor**\n3. In Blueprint, reference it and call **Play**\n\n```cpp\n// In Blueprint:\nEvent BeginPlay -> Get Level Sequence Actor -> Play\n```\n\n### **Method 2: Spawn and Play Dynamically**\nIn your Blueprint (like `Player_BP` or `Boss_BP`):\n\n1. Add a **Level Sequence** variable\n2. Set it to your sequence asset\n3. Use **Create Level Sequence Player** node\n4. Call **Play** on the player\n\n**Blueprint Flow:**\n```\nEvent -> Create Level Sequence Player \n      -> Set Playback Settings\n      -> Play\n```\n\n### **Method 3: Embedded in Actor Blueprint**\nAdd a **Level Sequence Player Component** directly to your rock actor\n\n## **What Level Sequences CAN Animate:**\n\n- ✅ **Static Mesh transforms** (position, rotation, scale)\n- ✅ **Material parameters** (color, opacity, etc.)\n- ✅ **Blueprint variables** and functions\n- ✅ **Particle effects** (Niagara/Cascade)\n- ✅ **Lights, cameras, audio**\n- ✅ **Visibility on/off**\n- ✅ **Physics** (switch between kinematic/simulated)\n\n## **Workflow for Your Rock Animation:**\n\n1. **Create Level Sequence** (Window → Cinematics → Level Sequence)\n2. **Add your rock pieces** to the sequence\n3. **Set keyframes** for transforms (no baking needed!)\n4. **Save the sequence**\n5. **In your game Blueprint**, reference and play it when needed\n\n### **Example: Trigger on Player Action**\nIn `Player_BP`:\n- Event (e.g., Press E)\n- → Create Level Sequence Player (set to your rock sequence)\n- → Play\n\nThe animation plays exactly as you created it in Sequencer!\n\n**The key difference:** AnimSequences are for skeletal animations, Level Sequences are for everything else and work directly in-game. No baking needed for objects!\n\nDoes this clear it up?

In **Event BeginPlay**: Play the sequence\n\n**In Player_BP (on collision):**\n\n```\nEvent: On Hit/Overlap\n  ↓\nGet Hit Location\n  ↓\nSpawn Actor from Class\n  - Class: BP_RockSpawn\n  - Spawn Transform: Hit Location\n  ↓\n(Rock animates at that location and can destroy itself when done)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Manually Position Objects Before Playing**\n\nIf your rocks are already in the world:\n\n**In Player_BP:**\n\n```\nEvent: On Collision\n  ↓\nGet Hit Location\n  ↓\nGet Reference to Rock Actors (Cylinder, Cylinder2)\n  ↓\nSet Actor Location (for each rock)\n  - New Location: Hit Location\n  ↓\nPlay Level Sequence\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Recommended Approach for Your Use Case:**\n\n**Use Option 2** - Blueprint Actor with embedded Level Sequence:\n\n### **Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Content Browser** → Right-click → **Blueprint Class** → **Actor** → Name: `BP_RockSpawnEffect`\n\n2. **In BP_RockSpawnEffect:**\n   - Add **Level Sequence Player** component\n   - Set **Sequence** = `Enemy_Animations_LS`\n   - In **Event BeginPlay**:\n     ```\n     Event BeginPlay\n       ↓\n     Level Sequence Player → Play\n       ↓\n     Delay (duration of animation)\n       ↓\n     Destroy Actor (self)\n     ```\n\n3. **In Player_BP** (when Niagara effect hits):\n   - **On Collision/Overlap Event:**\n     ```\n     Event Hit/Overlap\n       ↓\n     Get Hit Location\n       ↓\n     Spawn Actor from Class\n       - Class: BP_RockSpawnEffect\n       - Spawn Location: Hit Location\n     ```\n\n### **Important: Make Rocks Spawnable in Level Sequence**\n\nFor this to work properly, your rock pieces in `Enemy_Animations_LS` should be **Spawnables**, not Possessables:\n\n1. Open `Enemy_Animations_LS`\n2. Right-click Cylinder tracks → **Convert to Spawnable**\n3. Repeat for Cylinder2\n\nThis way, the rocks spawn at the actor's location (wherever you place `BP_RockSpawnEffect`), not at fixed world positions!\n\n---\n\n**Does this make sense?

Now that your cylinders are spawnables, here's how to spawn and play the animation at your player's location every 3 seconds:\n\n## **Step-by-Step Setup:**\n\n### **Step 1: Create Rock Spawn Actor Blueprint**\n\n1. **Content Browser** → Right-click → **Blueprint Class** → **Actor**\n2. Name it: `BP_RockSpawnAnimation`\n\n3. **Inside BP_RockSpawnAnimation:**\n   - Click **Add Component** → **Level Sequence Player**\n   - Select the component\n   - In **Details Panel**:\n     - **Sequence** = `Enemy_Animations_LS`\n     - **Auto Play** = ✓ Check this\n\n4. **In Event Graph:**\n   ```\n   Event BeginPlay\n     ↓\n   Get Component (Level Sequence Player)\n     ↓\n   Get Duration\n     ↓\n   Delay (Duration)\n     ↓\n   Destroy Actor (Self)\n   ```\n   \n   *(This makes the actor clean itself up after the animation finishes)*\n\n5. **Save and Compile**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Modify Player_BP to Spawn It**\n\n1. **Open Player_BP** (already open)\n\n2. **Replace your existing timer setup** with this:\n\n```\nEvent BeginPlay\n  ↓\nSet Timer by Function Name\n  - Function Name: \"SpawnRockAnimation\"\n  - Time: 3.0\n  - Looping: TRUE\n```\n\n3. **Create the SpawnRockAnimation function:**\n   - In **My Blueprint** panel → **Functions** → Click **+ Function**\n   - Name it: `SpawnRockAnimation`\n\n4. **Inside SpawnRockAnimation function:**\n   ```\n   SpawnRockAnimation\n     ↓\n   Get Actor Location (Self)\n     ↓\n   Spawn Actor from Class\n     - Class: BP_RockSpawnAnimation\n     - Spawn Transform:\n       - Location: (from Get Actor Location)\n       - Rotation: (0, 0, 0) or your desired rotation\n     - Collision Handling Override: Always Spawn, Ignore Collisions\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## **Blueprint Nodes Breakdown:**\n\n### **In Player_BP → SpawnRockAnimation Function:**\n\n**Node by Node:**\n\n1. **Drag in a \"Get Actor Location\"** node\n   - Target: Self (the Player)\n\n2. **Right-click** → Type **\"Spawn Actor from Class\"**\n   - **Class**: Select `BP_RockSpawnAnimation`\n   - **Spawn Transform**: \n     - Break the transform pin (right-click → Split Struct Pin)\n     - Connect **Get Actor Location** to the **Location** pin\n\n3. *(Optional)* Add **offset** to spawn slightly in front/below player:\n   ```\n   Get Actor Location\n     ↓\n   Add (Vector + Vector)\n     - Add offset like (0, 0, -100) to spawn below\n     ↓\n   Spawn Actor (Location pin)\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## **Quick Setup Checklist:**\n\n✅ **In Enemy_Animations_LS**: Cylinder & Cylinder2 converted to **Spawnable**  \n✅ **BP_RockSpawnAnimation**: Created with Level Sequence Player component  \n✅ **Player_BP**: Timer calling SpawnRockAnimation every 3 seconds  \n✅ **SpawnRockAnimation function**: Spawns BP_RockSpawnAnimation at player location\n\n---\n\n## **Result:**\n\nEvery 3 seconds:\n- A new rock spawn animation plays at your player's current position\n- The rocks animate according to your Level Sequence\n- The actor destroys itself after the animation completes\n\n**Test it:**\n1. Compile and save both Blueprints\n2. Play in Editor\n3. Every 3 seconds, rocks should spawn and animate at your player's feet!\n\n---\n\n**Need help with any specific part?** Let me know if you need clarification on spawning, the timer, or positioning the rocks!"},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0c6229-bd2b-6c8f-801d-a6ff6a5efbea"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
